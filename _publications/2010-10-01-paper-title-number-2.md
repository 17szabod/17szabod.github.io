<!-- Constraint satisfaction problems (CSP) encompass an enormous variety of computational problems.  In particular, all partition functions from statistical physics, such as spin systems, are special cases of counting CSP (\#CSP). 
We prove  a complete complexity classification
for every counting problem in \#CSP
with nonnegative valued constraint functions 
that is valid when every variable
occurs a bounded number of times in all constraints. We show that, depending on the set of constraint functions $$\mathcal{F}$$, every problem
in the complexity class \#CSP$$ (\mathcal{F}) $$  defined
by $$\mathcal{F}$$  is either polynomial-time computable for all
instances without the bounded  occurrence  restriction,
\emph{or}  is \#P-hard 
even when restricted to bounded degree input instances.
The constant bound in the degree depends on $\mathcal{F}$.
The dichotomy criterion on $\mathcal{F}$ is decidable.
As a second contribution,  we prove a slightly modified but more
streamlined decision procedure (from \cite{CCL}) to test for 
the tractability of $ \scsp(\mathcal{F}) $. This procedure on an input $\mathcal{F}$ 
tells us which case holds in the dichotomy for  $ \scsp(\mathcal{F}) $. This more
streamlined decision procedure enables us 
to fully classify a family of \emph{directed} weighted graph homomorphism problems.
This family contains both P-time tractable problems and \#P-hard problems.
To our best knowledge, this is the
first family of such problems explicitly classified that
are not \emph{acyclic}, thereby  the 
Lov\'{a}sz-goodness criterion of
Dyer-Goldberg-Paterson~\cite{dyer-goldberg-paterson} cannot be applied. -->
