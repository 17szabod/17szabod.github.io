I am a Ph.D. candidate in **Operations Research** at *Eötvös Loránd University* (2022–2026, expected).  
My research interests include **combinatorial optimization**, **computational counting complexity**, and **algorithmic redistricting**.

Previously, I earned my **M.Sc.** and **B.Sc.** in Computer Science and Mathematics at the *University of Wisconsin–Madison*, where I worked on redistricting algorithms and CSP counting dichotomies.

Recently, I have been working on partitioning problems in combinatorial optimization. These include certain generalizations of the multiway cut problem, and an extension of the principal partition sequence for submodular functions. More details can be found among my [publications](https://17szabod.github.io/publications/).
